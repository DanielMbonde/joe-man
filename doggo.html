  <h2>Graphs</h2>
   <div style="text-align: center;">  <img src="intelligence.png"> </div>
   <p> This is a pie graph representing the average intelligence level of different breeds of dogs. We chose to do a pie graph as it represented the data in much more clear way compared to line, bar, and dot graphs.</p>
   <div style="text-align: center;">  <img src="health.png"> </div>
   <p> This is another pie gragh representing the average level of health for different breeds of dogs. We chose to do a pie graph for the same reason we did for the intelligence. A clearer way to look at the information. </p>
   <div style="text-align: center;">  <img src="friend.png"> </div>
   <p> This is the last pie grapg representing the average friendliness to strangers for different breeds of dogs. We chose to do a pie graph for the last graph for the same reasons that we did for the rest of the graphs; a clear way to see information. </p>
   <div style="text-align: center;">  <img src="creative.jpg" width="748" height="589"> </div>
  <p> This last graph is pictures of the animals we had to choose from witht he percentages representing how many hoseholds own each animal. We presented it in this way as it allows you to see the different points of information in comparision to each other. </p>
   <h2>Data Analysis</h2>

   <h2> Conclusion </h2>
<br> <p> What can be considered the best pet? <br>
  <br> That is the question that we asked at the beginning of this experiment, and now we have an answer. <br>
   <br> We first look at two different data sets: Popular Pets + Man's Best Friend Part II. <br>
   <br> We decided to look at dogs as they were the highest owned pet per household. <br>
   <br> After analyzing the data we determined that the best pet can be considered a Siberian Husky. <br>
  <br> We made our decision by looking at three common atrributes to dogs. <br>
  <br> These attributes were: general health, intelligence, and friendliness to strangers. <br>
  <br> We found all the dogs that matched these attributes to a high standard. Those dogs were: Golden Retriever, Labrador Retriever, Vizla, Siberian Husky, and Yorkshire Terrier. <br>
   <br> We then had to choose which of these dogs would be the most ideal. We did this by looking at lifespan and we found that the Siberian Husky, on average, had the longest lifespan at 15 years. <br>
   <br> In conclusion, we first had to choose an animal to be our candidate. This animal was a dog. <br>
   <br> After that we looked at breeds of dogs and after analyzing our data we have determined the Siberian Husky to be the best pet. <br>
   <br> As a result of knowing what the best pet is, people looking for their first or maybe adding another pet to their family will now be able to know what pet they should be looking at. <br>
   <br> This matters to the future as people will continue to get pets and as our population grows so will the demand for pets. By knowing the Siberian Husky is the ideal pet it will allow people in the future to make more informed choices. </p> <br>
